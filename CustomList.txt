For the - function within my Custom List Project I was able to overload the "-" syntax to work with my custom list class.
The function takes in two parameters that are both instances of my custom list class.
After that the function creates a new custom list.
Then the 2 seperate parameters entered the function are comapared by all values of the first list indeices against the secondlist indeices.  
From there if the the values are not equal the value is added to new custom list.
If the values are equal then it is removed from the first list as to ensure there are no repeats of comparisons.
After all values are compared and the passing values have been entered into the new custom list the new custom list is returned.
The reurn type is  CustomList<T>.

An Example would be [1,2,3]-[2,4].
This example the 2 value would be removed and the return result would be a new list [1,3].
